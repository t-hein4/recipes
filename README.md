# Recipes

A project from the Odin Project

This project is to build a basic recipe website. The main goal here is to practice all the HTML knowledge I have acquired. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

   2. HTML formatting elements - strong, em, b, i, sub, sup, ins, del, mark, small
   3. HTML list - ol, ul, li, dl, dt, dd
   4. HTML link - a
   5. HTML image - img
2. HTML boilerplate
   1. DOCTYPE
   2. html
   3. head
   4. meta
   5. body
3. HTML attributes
   1. a - href, target, rel
   2. img - src, alt, height, width
   3. html - lang
